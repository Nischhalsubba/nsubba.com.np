== HOW TO USE THIS THEME (UPDATED) ==

This theme is now a powerful Hybrid Theme. You can edit design in the Customizer, but content has its own dedicated place.

1. **Adding Work (Case Studies):**
   - Go to your WordPress Dashboard.
   - Look at the sidebar on the left. Click on "Work (Projects)".
   - Click "Add New".
   - Enter the Title.
   - Use the main editor to write your case study text and upload images.
   - SCROLL DOWN to the "Custom Fields" section to add details like:
     - `project_year` (e.g. 2025)
     - `project_role` (e.g. Lead Designer)
     - `project_industry` (e.g. Fintech)
   - Set a "Featured Image" on the right sidebar (this appears on the homepage grid).

2. **Editing the Homepage:**
   - Go to Appearance > Customize.
   - Open "Home Page Builder".
   - You can change the Hero Title, Subtitle, and Portrait image here.
   - The "Selected Work" section automatically pulls your 3 most recent Projects.

3. **Changing Colors & Fonts:**
   - Go to Appearance > Customize.
   - Open "Design System".
   - Change Background Color, Accent Color, and Text Color instantly.

4. **Writing Blogs:**
   - Use the standard "Posts" menu in WordPress.
